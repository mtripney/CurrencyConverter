# CurrencyConverter ğŸ’· ğŸ‘‰ ğŸ’¶
A vanilla JavaScript currency converter, built with Tailwind. Uses the 'exchangerates' API for fast, up-to-date results.

A nice little exercise in asynchronous JavaScript, using the [exchangerates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) to draw up-to-date currency data. The user can, of course, enter an original currency and a destination currency, and receive a nicely formatted result.
